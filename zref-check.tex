\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  \pkg{zref-check} provides an user interface for making \LaTeX{}
  cross-references flexibly, while allowing to have them checked for
  consistency with the document structure as typeset.  Statements such as
  ``above'', ``on the next page'', ``previously'', ``as will be discussed'',
  ``on the previous chapter'' and so on can be given to \cs{zcheck} in
  free-form, and a set of ``checks'' can be specified to be run against a
  given \texttt{label}, which will result in a warning at compilation time if
  any of these checks fail.  \cs{zctarget} and the \texttt{zcregion}
  environment are also defined as a means to easily set label targets to
  arbitrary places in the text which can be referred to by \cs{zcheck}.
