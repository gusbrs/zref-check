## v0.3.0 (2022-04-22)

### Changed
- `zref-check` no longer accepts package options to be set a load-time,
  `\zrefchecksetup` must be used instead.  The use of load-time options now
  results in "Unknown option" LaTeX error.  This change requires that users
  adjust their documents, and a suitable package warning has been provided so
  that affected users know of the change directly and how to adjust.
