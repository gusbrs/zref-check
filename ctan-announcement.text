## v0.2.1 (2021-09-16)

### Changed
- Use `\msg_line_context:` instead of `\msg_line_number:` for messages.
- Use more efficient way to set checks as option keys in `\zcheck`.
- Spare setting end label in `\zcheck` for checks which don't need it.
- Separate `zref` property lists for checks and targets, so that only the
  minimum set of required properties for each are used.

### Added
- New `pagegap` check.
- Provide infrastructure for integration with `zref-clever`.
